# bash-scripts

Have you ever been annoyed by some of the most menial tasks in work or just life in general? It's the kind of things that are not hard but rather tedious to actually do it. 

If you want to automate these tedious tasks, you can download bash scripts to 
    
    1. calculate the greatest common divisor and lowest common multiple quickly

    2. calculate the length of a string

    3. change the case of text to uppercase or lowercase

I'll add new scripts along the way if I have more ideas
