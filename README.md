# bash-scripts

Have you ever been annoyed by some of the most menial tasks? It's the kind of things that is not hard to do but its way too tedious to actually do it. If you are a lazy ass like me, you can download bash scripts to 
    
    - calculate the greatest common divisor and lowest common multiple quickly
    
    - calculate the length of a string

    - change the case of text to uppercase or lowercase
