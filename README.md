# bash-scripts

Have you ever been annoyed by some of the most menial tasks in work or just life in general? 

It's the kind of things that is actually not hard to do but its pretty tedious to do it. If you are a lazy ass like me, you can download bash scripts to 
    
    1. calculate the greatest common divisor and lowest common multiple quickly
    
    2. calculate the length of a string

    3. change the case of text to uppercase or lowercase
    
I'll add new scripts along the way if I have more ideas
